# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an Obsidian vault - a personal knowledge management system containing markdown files organized as a collection of interconnected notes. The repository contains:

- **my-vault/**: Main vault directory with Welcome.md and other markdown files
- **actOfGotEnter/**: Secondary directory with additional markdown content
- **LICENSE**: CC0 1.0 Universal license (public domain dedication)

## Architecture

This is a content repository rather than a code repository. The structure follows Obsidian's vault conventions:

- Markdown files (.md) contain notes and documentation
- Files can reference each other using `[[wikilink]]` syntax
- No build process, testing, or compilation required
- Content is version-controlled using Git

## Working with this Repository

- Files are plain markdown and can be edited directly
- No special commands for building, testing, or linting
- Changes are tracked via Git commits
- The vault is licensed under CC0 (public domain)

## Note-Taking Conventions

- Use `[[double brackets]]` for internal links between notes
- Standard markdown formatting applies
- Welcome.md files serve as entry points for new vault sections
